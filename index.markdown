Gabriel is an undergraduate student studying mechanical engineering with a focus on environmental sustainability.
He is interested in applying engineering solutions to environmental issues in fields such as renewable energy and transportation. This webpage serves as a portfolio with some of Gabriel's work and several [posts](/posts) about various projects and interests.

## Wave-Powered Aquaculture

My research with the [SEA Lab](https://sea.mae.cornell.edu/) has focused on developing maps and modeling to asses the potential of wave-powered aquaculture along the northeast coast of the US. By estimating the carrying capacity of different locations and looking at potential conflicts between fisheries and offshore infrastructure, we have been able to identify promising sites along with yield and costs estimates for them.

I have focused on processing GIS datasets of environmental conditions and integrating them into the Python model that optimizes for carrying capacity and cost. I have also used some techniques from marine spatial planning to analyze other factors such as conflicts between offshore wind development and commercial fishing. This map shows some of those conflicts and highlights one of our optimal locations for a wave-powered aquaculture farm.


## Mechanical Synthesis

My course on mechanical synthesis focused on the design and manufacturing of mechanical components. I worked on two final projects as well as several smaller pieces and CAD models throughout the course including a Reuleaux machine and a milk frother.

For the original design project, we interviewed a nurse about his challenges transporting patients in a hospital setting, and created a prototype hospital bed to address this issue. The bed uses a removable stretcher, attachments for medical equipment, and a scissor lift mechanism to achieve this. We prototyped the device by laser-cutting the bed and scissor lift mechanism and using a rack and pinion to control the bed's lift. The second project involved designing a water pump. My group choose to create a peristaltic pump which pumps fluid without contact with the pump mechanism. Our design is adjustable and uses a combination of machined and laser-cut components.

Starting in 2019, I worked as a developer and lab technician at [Cyclikal](https://cyclikal.com/), a company providing high precision calorimetry testing for lithium-ion batteries.

My work focused on developing the [Cyckei](https://docs.cyclikal.com/projects/cyckei/en/stable/) software package which automates voltage and current steps and data handling while cycling li-ion cells. Older versions of the software and accompanying tools are open source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/cyclikal/cyckei).


## Hobby Components

I have also explored manufacturing small components with 3D printing and manual machining techniques. Some of these projects are bicycle related and stem from issues I have run into while working as a professional mechanic, while others are just to practice designing and fabricating various objects. Pictured are a selection of items I have made including machined aluminum top caps for bike cockpits, a front light and GoPro compatible mount, and some bits that help with common bike repairs such as hydraulic brake caliper service and bleeding.
