### Introduction

This post contains instructions for building a prototype of a speed controlled bike light. Using a hall sensor tachometer, this bike light activates a "brake light" when it detects deceleration.

### Purpose
Cycling has many environmental and health benefits for individuals and communities
that promote cycling. Unfortunately, our current transportation infrastructure often
makes biking inaccessible and dangerous. That fear of riding alongside other vehicles
is one of the biggest reasons people are hesitant to bike.1
Although we will need many policy and infrastructure changes to address this issue,
my individual project is a technical solution that aims to make bikes more visible and
increase the awareness of other road users. To do so, I’ve created a rear bike light
that responds to the rider’s speed and tells road users when a cyclist is coming to a
stop with a more visible brake light.
